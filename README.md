- Food/Cocktail Recipe App

Description:

This application allows users to search different food  recipes as well as mixtures for cocktails based on the type of liquor it requires. This application allows users to search for these recipes using server-side APIs incorporated into the code. This application allows users to search for drink/cocktail recipes all in one place while also storing history of previously searched recipes. For food, recipes can be searched based on the time it will take to make the meal. This is useful for people with time constraints. Food recipes can also be searched using a specific type of protein. Constucting this application brought up some challenges such as making all the different components of this application mesh together without messing up different fucntionalities that were sought to perform in the app. There are different ideas that can be incorporated into the app for it to expand in its functionality. One idea could be including an API that allows you to find directions to different breweries in close proximity. Another idea that can be incorporated is including vegetarian/vegan options as recipes for the app to be more inclusive to different diets.
